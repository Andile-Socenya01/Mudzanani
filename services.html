                <h5>What is criminal law?</h5>
                <p>Criminal law is the body of law that relates to crime. It prescribes conduct perceived as threatening, harmful, or otherwise endangering to the property, health, safety, and moral welfare of people inclusive of one's self. Most criminal law is established by statute, which is to say that the laws are enacted by a legislature. Criminal law includes the punishment and rehabilitation of people who violate such laws. <br>Criminal law varies according to jurisdiction, and differs from civil law, where emphasis is more on dispute resolution and victim compensation, rather than on punishment or rehabilitation. <br>Criminal procedure is a formalized official activity that authenticates the fact of commission of a crime and authorizes punitive or rehabilitative treatment of the offender.</p>

                <h5>What is criminal law?</h5>
                <p>It is of vital importance that your will is drafted in such a manner that it valid, binding and enforceable. The Act sets out certain requirements for a valid will. <br> <br> To ensure that the beneficiaries in your will is in accordance with your wishes, it is of vital importance to draft and amend your will annually. Your original will and testament will be archived and kept safe and a friendly staff member will contact you annually to enquire whether you require any changes to your existing will. <br> <br> If you do not have a valid testament when you die, everything that remains after all debts and administrative costs have been deducted, will be inherited through the laws of succession by your qualified beneficiaries.  All the assets in your deceased estate will be distributed by the Intestate Succession Act 81 of 1987.  To ensure that this does not happen, contact one of our team of experts at Burger Huyser Attorneys in Johannesburg to draft a will for you.</p>
